# Days 073-076 Web Scraping

Welcome to Web Scraping!

The next four days will be based on [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) (bs4) and [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Days 1 - 2: 

The first two days will be spent on bs4.

Day 1: Watch bs4 videos 3 - 5 on the first day and follow along. Try your hand at scraping additional data from the Talk Python Course listing page.

Day 2: Scrape your own sites! bs4 is extremely simple so you'll be able to take what you learned on Day 1 and apply it to websites of your choice.


## Days 3 - 4: 

Introducing newspaper3k.

Day 3: Follow along with the remaining videos, 6 - 8, and finish off the course.

After completing the example in the video, practice on other news articles of your choice. Get some practice in.

Day 4: Head to [http://newspaper-demo.herokuapp.com](http://newspaper-demo.herokuapp.com). This is the site used in the video to demo newspaper3k.

Reproduce this page using the Flask skills you've already learned in this course so far.

Tips:

- You're essentially just parsing the newspaper3k page for Authors; Publish Date; Text and Image.
- Decide whether you want the page to reload once the URL is entered or if you want to direct the user to a new page that renders the content.
- Don't fret if you can't get the page returning the exact same info, just do what you can.
- Focus more on the code/content than the HTML/CSS. We don't care how pretty this is.
