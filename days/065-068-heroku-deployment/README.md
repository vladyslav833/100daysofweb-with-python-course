# Days 065-068 Heroku Deployment

Welcome to Heroku Deployment!

Over the next four days we're going to take it easier and dive into Deploying a basic Flask App on Heroku as well as look at two handy Heroku add-ons.

## Days 1 - 2: 

Watch the first 5 videos and set up your Heroku git environment. Follow along with the videos to commit your first code to Heroku and build your first web-app.

Once you've done this, challenge yourself to deploy one of the Flask apps we've made in this course so far on Heroku!


## Days 3 - 4: 

Complete the rest of the videos.

Install the Heroku Scheduler and SendGrid Add-ons as per the videos and configure your own automation.

Think of ways to incorporate these add-ons into your own existing Flask apps if you have time.
