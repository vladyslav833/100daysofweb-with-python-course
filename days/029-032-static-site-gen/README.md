# Days 029-032 Static Site Generators

Welcome to Static Site Generators!

Over the next four days we're going to play with Pelican - a Python based Static Site Generator. After we build our base site we're also going to look at deploying the site online using Netlify!

## Days 1 - 2: 

We're taking a slightly different approach for this chapter.

Given the nature of the videos in this chapter we're asking that over the first two days you simply watch and follow along with the videos.

There's no need to dive too far into the coding, just get the site up and running and deployed on Netlify. Take the two days to do this.

Add some extra posts to the site if you have spare time and can't wait until Days 3 - 4.


## Days 3 - 4: 

Play time!

Build up your site over the remaining two days. You have the building blocks with static images and pages - now build!

- Add posts to bulk out your site.
- Create another few static pages. Eg: Privacy Policy; Terms and Conditions; Related Links
- Experiment with the HTML/CSS.
- Browse to [http://www.pelicanthemes.com/](http://www.pelicanthemes.com/) and pick a new theme! We use [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex/tree/b3bd59002a3e85803332c35702d90e1e19ef39b6) on [PyBites](https://pybit.es).
- Visit the [Pelican docs](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html) and take a look at the [Pelican Themes](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/pelican-themes.html) documentation to install the new theme you've selected.
- Customise and make it your own.

Note: Remember to keep your repository up to date on GitHub to allow Netlify to keep auto-building/updating.


### Time to share what you've accomplished!
