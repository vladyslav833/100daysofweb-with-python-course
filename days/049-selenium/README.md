# Day 49 Selenium

As we have only one day for this miscellaneous topic, watching the videos should suffice.

In this lesson we will test [PyBites My Reading List](https://pybitesbooks.com) Django app.

If you want to follow along with my code, [create a PyBites Books account](https://pybitesbooks.com/accounts/register/) and set your username and password in an `.env` file:

```
$ cp .env-template .env

# Open the .env file and fill out USERNAME and PASSWORD with your new PyBites Books credentials.
```

These two env variables get loaded in by the script.

The starter code can be found in the [start subdirectory](start), the final code is [here](final).
