# Days 057-060 Flask Login

Welcome to Flask Login!
The next four days will be pretty intense. We'll be covering some SQLAlchemy, forms and of course, Flask Login!

## Days 1 - 2: 

For the first two days you should try and get through the initial application creation videos as well as the videos regarding the creation of the SQLAlchemy Database.

You're looking at videos 1 - 9 so pace yourself and more on understanding the concepts. 

Code along with the videos, or after, just aim to have the DB created by the end of your first two days.


## Days 3 - 4: 

Complete the rest of the videos: 10 - 16.

These will cover off adding users to the database and the actual Flask Login plugin.

Again, it will be a bit of a learning curve if you've never worked on these before so focus on getting the concepts solidified.


## Extras:

If you happen to get through the 4 days work of videos early and want to challenge yourself further, consider trying the following.

- Look into how to implement Password Hashing. As it stands, for this demonstration, the passwords are visible and plain text. Password hashing will secure them.
- Start stress testing your application looking for bugs and exceptions that haven't been accounted for. Think incorrect data types; test identical usernames and so on.
- Make the app beautiful. Get your CSS on and bring the app out of the stone age!
- Implement other functions on the website such as having the logged in user's username appear at the top of every page when logged in.
